            <h2>What If Writing Code Didn‚Äôt Mean ‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù?</h2>
            <p>Imagine telling someone you‚Äôre a programmer, and they respond with:
                "Oh cool! I know HTML and CSS too!" <br/>But is that really programming? The short answer: No. But before we dive into why, let‚Äôs break it down with a simple analogy.</p>

            <h2>Building a Website Is Like Building a House</h2>

            <p>
               <h3> HTML ‚Üí The Framing & Structure </h3>
                    <p>
                        - HTML is like the skeleton of a house‚Äîthe wooden frame, walls, and layout. It determines where the rooms, windows, and doors go, but on its own, it‚Äôs just a bare structure.
                    </p>
                <h3>CSS ‚Üí The Paint, Wallpaper, & Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        - CSS is what makes the house look nice‚Äîthe paint, wallpaper, flooring, and exterior siding. It styles the house but doesn‚Äôt add any real functionality. <br/>
                        - You can live in a house with just walls and paint, but it wouldn‚Äôt be very functional without electricity or plumbing.
                    </p>

                <h3>JavaScript ‚Üí The Plumbing & Electricity</h3>
                    <p>
                        - JavaScript is what makes the house a full home. It‚Äôs the plumbing that allows the toilets to flush, the electricity that powers the lights, and the heating that keeps the house warm. <br/>

                        - Without JavaScript, your website is like a house without working lights, running water, or appliances. It looks nice, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything.

                    </p>

            </p>

            <h2>Programming vs. Markup: The Key Difference</h2>
            <p>
                Programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and C++ are designed to give computers instructions‚Äîthey handle logic, conditions, and decision-making. <br/>  
                HTML and CSS, on the other hand, describe how content should be structured and styled, but they don‚Äôt make decisions or perform actions. <br/>
                Let‚Äôs compare them:
            </p>

            <h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) ‚Üí The Blueprint</h3>
            <blockquote> Think of HTML like the skeleton of a webpage. It tells the browser what content exists (text, images, buttons), but not what to do with it.</blockquote> 
            <p>   
                Example:
            </p>

            <pre><code>
                &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image"&gt;
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>
                HTML doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo‚Äù anything‚Äîit just defines elements. 
            </p>


            <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) ‚Üí The Aesthetics</h3>
            <blockquote>CSS is what makes websites look beautiful and structured. It styles the HTML but doesn‚Äôt process logic or handle interactions.</blockquote>
            <p>
                Example:
            </p>

            <pre><code>
                p {
                    color: blue;
                    font-size: 16px;
                  }
                  
            </code></pre>
            

            <p>This changes how the paragraph looks, but there‚Äôs no programming logic involved.</p>

            <h3>What About JavaScript? ‚Üí The Brains of the Operation</h3>
            <blockquote>JavaScript is a true programming language because it controls behavior. It can take input, process data, and make decisions‚Äîjust like how plumbing and electricity bring a house to life.</blockquote>
            <p>
                Example:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
                let user = prompt("Enter your name:");
                alert("Hello, " + user + "!");                
            </code></pre>
            <p>This code asks for user input and responds‚Äîsomething HTML and CSS can‚Äôt do.</p>

            <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>

            <p>
                Understanding this distinction helps you:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>‚úÖ Know where to start as a beginner. (HTML & CSS first, then JavaScript.)</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Use the right terminology when applying for jobs.</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Recognize why JavaScript (or other languages) is required for actual programming.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>HTML and CSS are essential for web development, but they‚Äôre not programming languages‚Äîthey structure and style content, while JavaScript (and others) handle logic and functionality.</p>
