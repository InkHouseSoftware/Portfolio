				<h1>Programming Syntax Explained: Why It‚Äôs Just Like Speaking English</h1>	

				<h2>What If Programming Was Just Like Talking?</h2>

				<p>
					Imagine walking into a job interview and greeting the manager with, ‚ÄúAYO, WHATS UP!!‚Äù Probably not the best idea, right? Just like in English, different situations require different greetings‚Äîformal or informal. Programming languages work the same way.
				</p>

				<h3>Jose Sanchez</h3>
				
				<p>
					Section of date, socials, keyword serch query
				</p>

				<h2>Python vs. JavaScript: The Formal vs. Informal Greeting</h2>

				<p>
					Let‚Äôs compare Python and JavaScript using greetings as an analogy.
				</p>

				<h3>Python (Strongly Typed) ‚Üí Think of it like a formal greeting:</h3>

				<span>
					üìå "Hello, Mr./Mrs. Smith."
				</span>

				<p>	
					In Python, True must be written with a capital T. The language is strict about syntax, just like how you wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúyo‚Äù in a professional setting.

				</p>

				<h3>JavaScript (Loosely Typed) ‚Üí Think of it like an informal greeting:</h3>

				<span>
					üìå "AYO, WHATS UP!!"
				</span>

				<p>	
					In JavaScript, true and True both work. It‚Äôs more flexible, just like how you‚Äôd greet a friend differently than a boss.
				</p>

				<h2>Syntax: The Structure of Communication</h2>

				<h3>Key Differences Between JavaScript and Python Syntax:</h3>

				<P>
					1Ô∏è‚É£ Function Declaration: function vs. def 
				
					- JavaScript uses function to define a function. <br/>
					
					- Python uses def instead.<br/>
					
					2Ô∏è‚É£ Code Blocks: Curly Braces {} vs. Indentation<br/>
					
					- JavaScript uses curly braces {} to group code inside functions and loops.<br/>
					
					- Python relies on indentation (tabs or spaces) to define code blocks instead of {}.<br/>
					
					3Ô∏è‚É£ Line Endings: Semicolons vs. New Lines<br/>
					
					- In JavaScript, semicolons (;) are often used to separate statements (though they are optional).<br/>
					
					- In Python, line breaks determine the end of a statement‚Äîno semicolons needed.<br/>
				</P>

				<h3>Example: Writing the Same Function in Both Languages</h3>

				<p>
					Regardless of the language, the structure is what matters. If you can write a function in JavaScript, you can write one in Python‚Äîyou just need to learn its structure.
				</p>

				<h3>JavaScript Function Syntax:</h3>

				<p>
					function nameOfThisFunction (parameters) { <br/>
						// The code for this function <br/>
					}
				</p>

				<h3>Python Function Syntax:</h3>

				<p>
					def nameOfThisFunction(parameters):  <br/>
						// The code for this function 	
				</p>
				<p>
					The greeting in both languages is like the function definition‚Äîthey have different styles, but they serve the same purpose. Think of it like saying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in English vs. ‚ÄúHola‚Äù in Spanish‚Äîdifferent words, same meaning.
				</p>

				<h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>

				<p>
					I recommend starting with JavaScript because:
				</p>
				<p>
					‚úÖ It‚Äôs flexible and forgiving. <b/r>
					‚úÖ You can begin with HTML & CSS, which aren‚Äôt programming languages but are essential for web development.<br/>
					‚úÖ JavaScript makes HTML & CSS interactive, bringing websites to life.<br/>
				</p>

				<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
				<p>
					No matter where you start, programming is about understanding structure. If you can grasp how one language works, switching to another is just about learning its formal vs. informal rules.
